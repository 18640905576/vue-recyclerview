going to grab the","Yes","In router, I think, would let's say, for example","So let's make it can be just this the hour mark on the actual contents","We just loads though it was the way, a nice this","Are you would be a little bit more pretty raw, this is a day, dude","Border","radius, that","And I'm going to just do that will take something else","And thank you might now","That is the next time, I'm going to come into misc","And somebody actually not","source equals home","But if I was sending me to resolve where we go","All right","And it makes JavaScript","And I have run again","Normally a massive, as I said, this is always, I'm going to call the different [INAUDIBLE] Hm","Wow","We have happen on screen, and the otherwise, don't want","Yeah, and forth in the new

all","No","I feel I agree","It would actually get it, because otherwise, we still have this","routes","keys","So this is a layout boundary","It's the cause","Yeah, 3 pixels","OK","So since that's true","And this stuff","And that work","Good point, or strict, and then the URL, changed","But I'm going to, let's see, what we're any","So the new view, think about","And then we've defer, why

actually","But that they've all been set it","Yeah","And at the top and misc here","But it will be run into a bit different sections","And I think you'd want each of there's no DOM tree reason","Well, yeah","OK, so we have a couple of click for clicks","And so if we see about this","So what I think things that I really good start","script tags at home, kids","Don't do this file to

definitely","So when the mindset off chaining [INAUDIBLE] out of the same index HTML elements","Views","Yeah","So I'm going to createRoutes, wee, clearRoutes equals static","Let's do this, status is

going to do","We'll do that","And hopefully, you're here in slash about view but we're going to be whichever view was the new view is that","so that the event that isn't get called, all subscribing to do today","And then we're just delete the JavaScript language","Yeah, and we need to extends HTMLElement","And we app where we actually uncanny valid concept for the out animation","duration","count in one tends HTML, I think, would then we've defer, why not","Let's see what's good on here","So if you say layout, for example","Yes, so one of its scope","What we want to do, I supposed to find out","The defer mean to your Custom Elements JavaScript says we don't have","We don't want to say this, so one that you click back to then dot the even though it","So there a createdCallback, so we

too longer and I will say this","routes","because it matches the current ones will now needs to be run against that going to say const view back","And then what the createRoute","That's what I think","So we have to transitions, particular if branch of this, you're giving us way too much better","So since the layout, OK","I think we'll create objects anymore","You let us know what I'm going to do is I'm going to do is let's just find out","createdCallbacks","So if view","I could do if we don't want to make a nav","So I'm going to do that","Super","route","So for this, right now, all the like shouldNotMakeMoreOutPromise","resolve","Same for the power of Promise, right","Because why not","Let's give it or not","The defer also means that the state by selecting the view","No","Interesting","So the brand","new thing","So let's see, so we do that","All being well, we end with an actually hoping I will be remove this","Are you this","So we want to do that, actually just kind of amazing","You know","Yeah","","which is the current view was the new one that's a layout","I don't you ask the question ties in it is when it's like a progressive to deal with, with contain strict","now here","And I'm going to us","So onChanged","Yeah","Because of the this","is","the","active","view","And we are building the routes equals this","But when the view first time we create that isn't it","Right","Yeah, that is amazing","And I think, a more bugs","Yeah, I want it to updating to do that I have new view, and some Promise, we can actually can do here","This is Paul","Hi","This time I write bugs, don't like this is actual lifecycle called ES6","ES2016 was doing that's why I wanted to say","currentView will be fast because","You know what, in the back to the current view","And then we'll say return","One of the panels","OK","Come of that stuff out","Should that the evaluation from 100","no, should add that kind of got allowing that back out, right","newView, newView, what we're kind of got these views that you, very wrong","But if you about using there","Because the nav has disappear ago, it was the keyword for all the regular expression and execution of a router","Now you know, over that, in there","Let's do that there we already got ourselves some of the way to go","And it matches the new one for that","Yeah","And certain time gaps, think it's an animating to put a route for some reason","view","Figure out things simplicity at this point","So what we're being a little bit of a pickle over right now we've deep","linked that could want it to be that","So let's just feels very interactions back in so this","newView","Yeah","And apparent, what we'd want each one of all the debugger standard one","So this way, it should add the
